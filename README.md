# Mazes

Python implementations for maze generation, visualization, and solving.

## Intro

I've stumbled upon an article about an archeological examination of a game for Atari called [Entombed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entombed_(Atari_2600)). The interesting part was about an endless maze generation with laughably small memory available (literally few dozen bites). This made me realize I have never looked into maze generation, so I went to wikipedia's [Maze Generation Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maze_generation_algorithm) page and instantly wanted to implement recursive split algorithm. It was also a good opportunity to figure out Python's standard `tkinter` GUI library.

Doing some research I found an abosultely amazing [Jamis Buck's blog](http://weblog.jamisbuck.org/under-the-hood/) with 12 (!!!) algorithms for maze generation and this got me hooked. I had to implement a generic mini framework for maze generation, solving, and visualization, where you can simply add a class with a generator or a solver, and get a nice visualization.

$ python3 maze_client.py --algs
List of supported maze generation algorithms:

        0       Recursive split
                Parameters: ['halves', 'random']
        1       Recursive backtracking
        2       Hunt-and-kill
        3       Kruskal's
        4       Binary tree
                Parameters: ['NE', 'NW', 'SE', 'SW']
        5       Growing tree
                Parameters: ['<policy:weight>[,<policy:weight>...]']

All parameters are optional, algorithms use built-in defaults.
    
Growing tree algorithm supports following policies:

    o|oldest,n|newest,r|random,m|middle

Default policy is "r" which always select the oldest element from stack
which effectively implements Prim's algorithm. Other interesting combinations:

    n       Pick the newest cell on stack, implements Recursive Backtracking
    o       Pick the oldest cell on stack, produces a curious degenerated maze
    m       Pick a cell in the middle of stack, a variation of 'o'
    n:1,r:1 Pick the newest or random cell with equal probability (50/50)
    n:1,o:1 Pick the newest or oldest cell with equal probability (50/50)
    n:2,o:1 Pick the newest or oldest cell with 2:1 ratio
    o:1,r:1 Pick the oldest or random cell with equal probability (50/50)
```

## Examples

### Recursive split

Recursive splitting 50/50 and opening a randomly positioned door:

`$ python3 maze_client.py -n 10 -w 30 -d 0.2`

![](images/maze-split-halves.gif)

Recursive splitting at a random point and opening a randomly positioned door:

`$ python3 maze_client.py -n 10 -w 30 -d 0.2 -a 2`

![](images/maze-split-random.gif)

### Recursive backtracking

`$ python3 maze_client.py -n 10 -w 30 -d 0.2 -a 2`

![](images/maze-recursive-bt.gif)

### Hunt-and-kill

Does not require backtracking, thus generates less windy passages

`$ python3 maze_client.py -n 10 -w 30 -a 3 -d 0.15 --start 4 4 --finish 9 4`

![](images/maze-hunt-and-kill.gif)

### Kruskal's algorithm

An easy to implement algorithm if you have UnionFind data structure. If you don't, UF is easy to implement too ;-)

`python3 maze_client.py -n 10 -w 30 -d 0.07 -a 4 --solver bfs  --finish 9 4`

![](images/maze-kruskal.gif)

### Binary tree algorithm

Does not require state, extremely simple to implement. The downside is an express bias; below example has a south-east bias.

`$ python3 maze_client.py -n 10 -w 30 -a 5 -d 0.07 --finish 9 4`

![](images/maze-bt-se.gif)

### Growing tree algorithm

An interesting algorithm which is simple to implement with the behaviour adjustable by how it selects the next cell to process:

- Create an empty bag to hold cells. Put one random cell in it
- Pick a cell from the bag and remove a wall between it and any neighbouting unvisited cell. Add this new cell to the bag. If there are no unvisited neighbors, remove the cell from the bag
- Repeat until no cells left in the bag

Possible strategies for picking a cell from the bag:

- always pick the most recently added item, which effectively recreates recursive backtracking algorithm
- always pick a random item, in which case it becomes the Prim's MST algorithm where edges are selected randomly rather than by weight
- always pick the oldest item in the bag; this generated a degenerated maze.

The implementation allows to specify weighted strategies like so:

   `-p <policy:weight>[,<policy:weight>,...]`

This allows simulation of combined strategies, for example picking the newest item and a random item with 2:1 ration: `-p n:2,r:1`.

#### Always pick a random cell - Prim's:

`$ python3 maze_client.py -n 10 -w 30 -s 3 -a 5 -p r --finish 9 4`

![](images/maze-gt-prim.gif)

#### Oldest vs Oldest/Newest 1:1

Picking always oldest creates a sort of degenerated maze, but once selection alternates between oldest and newest cell a nice looking maze is generated with longer streight sections but verall shorter passages (i.e. combination of recursive backtracking and degenerated always-oldest variant):

| Oldest |  Oldest/Newest 1:1 |
| --- | --- |
| ![](images/maze-gt-str-o.gif) | ![](images/maze-gt-str-no.gif) |

Generated with:

```
$ python3 maze_client.py -n 10 -w 30 --solver bfs -s 2 -a 5 -p o --finish 9 4
$ python3 maze_client.py -n 10 -w 30 --solver bfs -s 2 -a 5 -p o:1,n:1 --finish 9 4
```

#### Newest vs Newest/Random 1:1

Always picking the newest cell results in recursive backtracking behavious, but if random picking is thrown in, the algorithm starts generating shorter passages with more options.

| Newest |  Newest/Random 1:1 |
| --- | --- |
| ![](images/maze-gt-str-n.gif) | ![](images/maze-gt-str-nr.gif) |

Generated with:

```
$ python3 maze_client.py -n 10 -w 30 --solver bfs -s 2 -a 5 -p n:1 --finish 9 4
$ python3 maze_client.py -n 10 -w 30 --solver bfs -s 2 -a 5 -p n:1,r:1 --finish 9 4
```

#### Newest/Random/Oldest 2:1:1 vs Newest/Random/Oldest 1:1:2

Fascinating to watch a significant the visual difference in algorithm progression with a slight change of how cells are picked:

| Newest/Random/Oldest 2:1:1 |  Newest/Random/Oldest 1:1:2 |
| --- | --- |
| ![](images/maze-gt-str-n2ro.gif) | ![](images/maze-gt-str-nro2.gif) |

Generated with:

```
$ python3 maze_client.py -n 10 -w 30 --solver bfs -s 2 -a 5 -p n:1,r:1,o:2 --finish 9 4
$ python3 maze_client.py -n 10 -w 30 --solver bfs -s 2 -a 5 -p n:2,r:1,o:1 --finish 9 4
```
