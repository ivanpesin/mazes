# Mazes

Python implementations for maze generation, visualization, and solving.

## Intro

I've stumbled upon an article about an archeological examination of a game for Atari called [Entombed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entombed_(Atari_2600)). The interesting part was about an endless maze generation with laughably small memory available (literally few dozen bites). This made me realize I have never looked into maze generation, so I went to wikipedia's [Maze Generation Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maze_generation_algorithm) page and instantly wanted to implement recursive split algorithm. It was also a good opportunity to figure out Python's standard `tkinter` GUI library.

Doing some research I found an abosultely amazing [Jamis Buck's blog](http://weblog.jamisbuck.org/under-the-hood/) with 12 (!!!) algorithms for maze generation and this got me hooked. I had to implement a generic mini framework for maze generation, solving, and visualization, where you can simply add a class with a generator or a solver, and get a nice visualization.

## Syntax

```
$ python3 maze_client.py -h
usage: maze_client.py [-h] [-a A] [--algs] [-d D] [-n N] [-w W]

Creates an NxN maze using the specified algorithm.

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -a A                  maze generation algorithm
  --algs                list supported maze generation algorithms
  -d D                  simulation delay in seconds, can be a fraction
  --start_delay START_DELAY
                        delay on start, can be a fraction
  -n N                  maze dimention
  -w W                  tile width
  --start START START   maze entrance coordinates
  --finish FINISH FINISH
                        maze exit coordinates

$ python3 maze_client.py --algs
List of supported maze generation algorithms:

        0       Recursive split 50/50
        1       Recursive split at random
        2       Recursive backtracking
        3       Hunt-and-kill
        4       Binary tree (SE biased)
```

## Examples

### Recursive split

Recursive splitting 50/50 and opening a randomly positioned door:

`$ python3 maze_client.py -n 10 -w 30 -d 0.2`

Recursive splitting at a random point and opening a randomly positioned door:

`$ python3 maze_client.py -n 10 -w 30 -d 0.2 -a 2`

### Recursive backtracking

`$ python3 maze_client.py -n 10 -w 30 -d 0.2 -a 2`

### Hunt-and-kill

Does not require backtracking, thus generates less windy passages

`$ python3 maze_client.py -n 10 -w 30 -a 3 -d 0.15 --start 4 4 --finish 9 4`

### Binary tree algorithm

Does not require state, extremely simple to implement. The downside is an express bias; below example has a south-east bias.

`$ python3 maze_client.py -n 10 -w 30 -a 4 -d 0.07 --finish 9 4`
